## About Me

***
I’m usually emotional and active person.  I like to laugh and joke.I have got a sense of humor. I’m hard-working and ambitious. I set high goals for myself and I work hard to reach them. I’m sociable, so I have got a lot of friends. I appreciate people’s honesty, frankness and politeness. I don’t like when people are rude and aggressive.I have got some hobbies. I’m always very busy but when I’m free I like coding and I think that nowadays becoming a developer is one of the best career choices someone can make, not only because of the great job opportunities available but also because of the huge rewards in terms of personal satisfaction, self development and creative expression.
